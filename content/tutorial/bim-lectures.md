Building Information Modeling (BIM) defined as:

>"_A digital representation of `physical` and `functional` characteristics of a facility. A BIM is a `shared knowledge resource` for information about a facility forming a reliable basis for `decisions` during its `life-cycle`; defined as existing from earliest conception to demolition._"

## Lecture 01 - Intro:
Lecture 01 is about introduction to BIM. It contains basic definitions, explanation and uses of BIM. Click on [link](https://github.com/fslurrehman/BIM-Lectures/raw/master/lecture01/lecture%2001.pptx) to download lecture 01. Student is required to note his/her classwork in a dedicated mini-project copy and bring laptop for practice work. Student shall write summary of lecture and email it to me. 

## Lecture 02 - 2D Drafting and Modify tools:
Lecture 02 is about familiarizing ourselves with interface of FreeCAD. It explains few commands from 2D Drafting and Modify toolbar. You can download its tutorial from this [link](https://github.com/fslurrehman/BIM-Lectures/raw/master/lecture02/Steps%20for%202Drafting%20and%20Modifying%20toolbar.docx). Student shall write summary of lecture and email it to me. 

## Lecture 03 - Setting up Levels and Grids:
Lecture 03 explains further how to work in freeCAD using draft workbench. It explains traditional 2D drafting tutorial from FreeCAD manual (page 64-79). You can download its elaborated and more helpful steps from this [link](https://github.com/fslurrehman/BIM-Lectures/raw/master/lecture03/Steps%20for%20Working%20with%20Draft%20Workbench.docx)
You can download its helpful files from my [github repo for this course](https://github.com/fslurrehman/BIM-Lectures/tree/master/lecture03/lab-3-freecad-files). Lecture 03 is in progress. Further explanation for levels and gridviews will be added later on. Student shall write summary of lecture and email it to me.  

## Lecture 04 - Working with Views:
Lecture 04 is about further working with BIM tool and practicing tasks related to modifying BIM Objects. Currently an introductory tutorial is covered. This tutorial can be downloaded from this [link](https://github.com/fslurrehman/BIM-Lectures/raw/master/lecture04/BIM%20ingame%20tutorial.pdf). Student shall write summary of lecture and email it to me.
